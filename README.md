# TruStacks Software Delivery Engine

## What is TruStacks?

TruStacks is a generative software delivery engine that removes the need to build pipelines.

#### Generative Sofware Delivery

*Intermediary Wiring* is the pipeline code that sits between the source and the delivered product that is typically implemented with yaml or other no-code DSL's.

TruStacks uses a rule engine to generate actions plans that contain actions based on discovered facts in the application sources.
