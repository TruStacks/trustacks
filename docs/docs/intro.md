# Welcome to TruStacks

## What is TruStacks?

TruStacks is a CI/CD orchestration tool that eliminates the complexity of building software pipelines.

## Why TruStacks?

CI/CD is essential for effective software teams. Unfortunately existing CI/CD offerings have the same underlying issues:
- Writing pipelines is tedious and error prone 
- Slow feedback increases implmentation time
- DSLs lack the flexibility and testability of programming langauges

##### The TruStacks difference

TruStacks removes the intermediary "wiring" between your source code and the actions that deliver your product.

The TruStacks engine is able to:
- discover what languages and frameworks you are using
- identify target deliverables such as containers or binaries
- identify target destinations such as kubernetes or FaaS

These capabilities and more enable TruStacks to intelligently build an action plan eliminating the need to build the pipeline yourself.
