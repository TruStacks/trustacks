# Plan

### What is an action plan?

An action plan is a set of actions that are selected based on the contents of an applications's source code.

## Your First Action Plan

To get started, [fork](https://github.com/TruStacks/react-sample/fork) and clone the sample application repo.

:::tip
You may use your own project for this tutorial. View the list of supported actions [here](/actions).
:::

### Generate the action plan

Navigate to the repo source and run the following command from the root of the source:

```
tsctl plan
```

This command generates an action plan in the current directory called `trustacks.plan`.

Run `tsctl explain trustacks.plan` to view the actions that were discovered from the source.

:::info
If you get the error `No actions could be generated from the provided source`, then the engine was unable to match any actions from the source.
