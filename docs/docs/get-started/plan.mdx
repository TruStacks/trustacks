# Plan

This part of the guide will get you started with your first action plan.

### What is an action plan?

An action plan is a set of actions that are selected based on the contents of an applications's source code.

## Your First Action Plan

To get started, [fork](https://github.com/TruStacks/react-sample/fork) the sample application repo.

### Generate the action plan

In the TruStacks web console, click the **New Action Plan** button in the option bar. Enter the url of your repo fork.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="https"
  values={[
    {label: "https", value: "https"},
    {label: "ssh", value: "ssh"}
  ]}
  >
  <TabItem value="https">If you are using https with a private repo, enter your username and password.</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ssh">If you are using ssh, you will prompted to enter a deploy key before generating the action plan.</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Leave the sub-path input empty since are using the project root to generate the action plan.

Click **Generate Action Plan**

:::tip
SSH urls will prompt for a key. 

After entering the key, click **Generate Action Plan**.
:::

:::info monorepos
The sub-path input allows for a single repo to have multiple action plan targets, with the limitation that all sub-paths must be self-contained. 

*Monorepos will be covered in detail in the core concepts*.
:::

After a few seconds, the action plan will be generated and you should now have an action plan in your action plans list named `trustacks-react-sample` (unless you renamed your fork).

Click the action plan list item to display the discovered actions. Click on an action to get a brief description of what the action does.

### "There Is No Spoon"

Where is the pipeline? You are looking it... sort of. 

TruStacks takes an orchestration through classification approach. Actions are not simply selected by the system, they are also understood. With ***Source-to-Action*** TruStacks "builds pipelines" with no pipeline code. 

This enables action plans to be changed on the fly as developers and application sources grow and mature.
